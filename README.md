###Project Description
This project uses OpenCV in Python to detect a raised hand and count the number of fingers shown. By processing webcam video input, it identifies the hand, segments it, and counts how many fingers are extended.

###The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever found yourself in a crowded room where everyone‚Äôs raising their hands and you have absolutely no clue how many fingers they‚Äôre holding up? Or perhaps you just want your computer to know your finger count without saying a word‚Äîbecause why not? Also, isn‚Äôt it just too mainstream to count fingers manually these days?

###The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter the magic of OpenCV! We wave our digital wand (aka Python code), capture your hand on camera, and voil√†‚Äîyour finger count is displayed on screen like a digital psychic reading. It‚Äôs like giving your computer a high-five that it actually understands. No more awkward finger guessing games; this solution turns finger counting into a fun, futuristic hand-shake party with your PC!
